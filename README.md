DEPRECATED (cured my schizophrenia)

# LOL-tracker
tracker for league of legends. runs on command line, 100% python. treat it like a crude OSINT tool. 
much functionality to come.
i think since this uses the non-commercial API endpoint (or perhaps for another reason) the match history is limited. It doesn't really want to show matches from over a year ago.
